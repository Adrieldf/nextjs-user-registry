## Usage

- To access any page with data you need to be logged in, if you don't have a account you can create a new one in the Sign Up button on the login page.

- In the Dashboard there is a counter for how much users are registered in the database and have the status as active.
- In the Users page, you can see a paginated list of the current users registered.
- In the top bar you have a debug menu with 2 buttons to add or remove pre-defined users so you don't have to register every single one manually.
